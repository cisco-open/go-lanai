## General Build Targets
# generate:
# 	Invoke "go generate" on defined targets
# 	This target typically run on CI/CD working machine
generate: $(GEN_LIST)

# test:
# 	Invoke "go test" on defined modules.
# 	This target typically run on CI/CD working machine
test: generate
	$(GO) test -count=1 -v -failfast -timeout 0 -coverprofile $(DESTDIR)/coverage.out $(MODULE)/pkg/...

# build:
# 	Generate executable binary and copy resources to $(DESTDIR)
# 	this target should be run on targeted OS.
#	e.g. build is executed inside Docker container when building Docker image
build: $(EXECS) copy-resources

# copy-resources:
#	Copy resources to $(DESTDIR) based on $(RES_LIST)
# 	This target should be run on targeted OS.
#	e.g. build is executed inside Docker container when building Docker image
copy-resources: $(RES_LIST)

# clean:
# 	Undo previous "build".  clean $(DESTDIR) and build cache
# 	This target should be run on targeted OS.
clean:
	$(GO) clean
	rm -rf $(DESTDIR)/*


## Docker
## Prerequisites for building docker image:
## 		- Working machine should have access to relative private Git repositories. (setup by "init-once")
##		- Working machine's ~/.ssh/id_rsa should be added via "ssh-add" for private GitHub servers
##		- Minimum Docker version on working machine is 18.09

# init-docker:
# 	Initialize for building docker image. Typically run on CI/CD worker machine
init-docker: init
	# ssh-add is necessary for build-docker
	$(SSHADD) -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# build-docker:
# 	Initialize for building docker image. Typically run on CI/CD worker machine
build-docker:
build-docker: init-docker test
	$(DOCKER) build -f "build/package/Dockerfile" --ssh default --progress=plain . -t europa:latest


## CI/CD

## Distribution



#The following example is useful for CI CD scenarios such as nightly build, PR review and stable release.
#For example:
# 1. Nightly build can use pre-build and post-build-tag-only with the actual build in the middle.
#    This will result in a tag off of the main branch.
# 2. Promoting of certain build from a tag or branch can use pre-build and post-build with the actual build in the middle.
# 	 This will result in a tag off of the main branch. The updated go.mod will also be merged back into the main branch.
# 3. PR verification can use pre-verify. This will not create any tag or commits.
# For more details, see the build.md file in the docs directory.

# TODO probably pre-build
#useful for PR review - get mod file ready but no commit
#need to provide module to be updated
# e.g. make pre-build module=cto-github.cisco.com/NFV-BU/go-lanai:develop
pre-build: update-dependency drop-replace

# TODO pre-dist
#useful for any build - creates two commits. the first commit can be used to merge back to main branch. the second commit can be used for tagging
#need to provide temporary branch name, and module to be updated
# e.g. make pre-build module=cto-github.cisco.com/NFV-BU/go-lanai:develop branch-name=tmp
pre-dist: git-branch update-dependency git-commit-dep-update drop-replace git-commit-drop-replace

#useful for nightly build - tag the build, but do not merge back to main branch
#need to provide tag value, and the original branch. The original branch value is needed to clean up the temporary branch created.
#(switch to original branch and delete the temporary branch)
# e.g. make post-build-tag-only tag-version=0.0.1 original-branch=develop remove-branch=tmp
post-dist-tag-only: git-tag git-publish-tag git-clean-up

# TODO post-dist
#useful for release build - tag the build, and also merge back to main branch with the updated dependencies
#publish tag after merge so both push and push tags is at the very end.
#need to provide tag value, and original branch to merge back to
# e.g. make post-build tag-version=0.0.1 original-branch=develop remove-branch=tmp
post-dist: git-tag git-pop-commit-from-back git-merge-back git-publish-tag git-clean-up


#Used to update the module dependency versions
#Will update go.mod's dependency to given branch's latest commit
#This target requires a command line input to specify from which branch to update the dependency
# The dependency version can either be a branch - useful for PR verification
# Or it can be a version query - useful for builds that are tagged (nightly or release)
# e.g make update-dependency module=cto-github.cisco.com/NFV-BU/go-lanai@develop
update-dependency:
	$(CLI) deps update --modules=$(module)

# e.g. make drop-replace module=cto-github.cisco.com/NFV-BU/go-lanai:develop
# or make drop-replace module=cto-github.cisco.com/NFV-BU/go-lanai
#use this after dependency is updated and replace directive is dropped.
#Because if there is a replace directive but the module that's replaced is not being used,
#go mod tidy will remove the dependency but not the replace directive. That would leave the go.mod in an error state
